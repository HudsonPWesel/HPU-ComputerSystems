### What I've learned about C

- Preprocessor & preprocessor directives

- printf
  - format specifers (%s, %d, %p, %c, %f)

- scanf
  - Uses pointers to variables
  - Returns number of variables successfully read
  - Divided by newline and spaces


### Semester goals

- Little C projects I make through the course
- Small C project for larger sections
- Capstone project (Building my own kernel)
